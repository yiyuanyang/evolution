# Neural Net Evolution

Modern day neural nets rely significantly on back propagation.
However, the most effective way we humans select most most capable
people or the most powerful way nature select the most fitting
is through survival of the fittest.

In this project, I'll try to simulate the evolution process of neural
network and compare its results with the traditional backpropagation.
